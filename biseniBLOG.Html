    <h1>BISENI OIL SPILLAGE</h1>
    <p>In 2018, SDN visited Biseni, a community in Bayelsa State, to learn more about the local impact of the oil industry. We spoke to community members about the challenges they face.
 Oil pollution is a major issue in the Niger Delta, with millions of people depending on land and water resources contaminated by oil spills.
 We will use what we learnt as part of our ongoing work to promote a cleaner, healthier environment in the Niger Delta.
 SDN conducts research on environmental issues in the Niger Delta, and runs projects based on this to address some of the social and other challenges associated with these issues.</p>
